# Image Analysis using Python and Microsoft Azure

## What is Image Analysis?
Image analysis is the process of analyzing an image to determine what it contains.
This is useful for determining what an image contains, such as a face, a car, or a dog etc. This is a common task in computer vision. 

## What is Azure Cognitive Services?
Azure Cognitive Services is a cloud service that provides image analysis services.
It is a collection of APIs that can be used to analyze images. This includes face analysis, computer vision, and more.

# Execute and Analyze Images using the following commands:
## Step 1: Install the Python SDK for Azure Cognitive Services
```
pip install msrest
```
```
pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision
```

## Step 2: Run the project script to get the image analysis results
```
python imgAnalysis.py
```

### Note :
To analyse different images, add new Images in the `data` folder, and change the image path in the imgAnalysis.py script.
